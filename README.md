This web application will be the first source of information for 1st year students at the University of Newcastle. Students feel lost in the first few weeks of uni and sometimes, when they start understanding the dynamics of some of the internal processes, courses and assignments, the semester is already in week 6 or so. Here are some important points that could be addressed:
Information about basic university services and where to find important information.
Who is who in our Discipline, School and Faculty (a directory). Not for every academic, but for every position (Program Convenor, Head of School, etc).
Induction for “Before uni starts TO-DO list” to “What you need to know by week 1”.
What a typical semester will look like and feel like.
What are the 'traps' that students can fall into. Things that you know now, that you wish you knew in your first week of classes.
FAQs and testimonials.
Other important aspects:
Must use a mix of text and multimedia (diagrams, graphs, photos, video content and animations).
Must look professional and be easy to use.
Must target domestic and international students.
Must be flexible. What if the Program Convenor for Information Technology changes? How can that information be updated in your system? What if I want to add new testimonials?
Must be a full-stack development: front-end and back-end. Most of the content should be hosted in the back-end and the website will pull that information to populate the page. Minimal hard-coded information should be present in the front-end.
